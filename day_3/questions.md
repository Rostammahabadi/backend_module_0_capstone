## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
puts "A conditional statement is a type of statement where when the condition is
met, the code following will run"
`if c == y
  puts "Correct"`

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?
"Someone could use an if-statement to write code which is conditional such that
if the conditions are met, the proceeding code would be run"
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
if condition = true
  puts "code here"
end
1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?
if condition = true
  puts "code here"
elsif condition = true
  puts "code here"
end
1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
if condition = true
  puts "code here"
elsif condition = true
  puts "code here"
else condition = true
  puts "code here"
end
1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
there is another way to use conditional statements with the "case" feature
the case is the condition and you use when statements to say "when something is
true, run the code"
for example:
a = 5
case = a
when 5
  puts "code here"
when 6
  puts "code here"
else
  puts "code here"
end
