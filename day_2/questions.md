## Day 2 Questions

1. Create an array containing the following strings: `"zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"`.
* `["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`
1. Save the array you created above to a variable `animals`.
* `animals = ["zebra", "giraffe", "elephant"]`
1. using the array `animals`, how would you access `"giraffe"`?
* `animals[1]``
1. How would you add `"lion"` to the `animals` array?
* `animals.push("lion")`
1. Name and describe two additional array methods.
* the method `array.pop` removes the last item in the array
* the method `array.shift` moves the index of the array to the right, deleting the first element
1. What are the boolean values in Ruby?
* true and false
1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `2` is equal to `25`? What is the result of this evaluation?
* Evaluation of equality is `==` so the code would be `2 == 25`
* the result of the evaluation would be `false`
1. In Ruby, how would you evaluate if `25` is greater than `2`? What is the result of this evaluation?
* You would run the greater than to evaluation with `>` so the code would
be `25>2` and the result of this evaluation would be `true`
